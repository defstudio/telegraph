Associating one or more chats to a bot, it is enabled to send messages to that chat and interacting with commands

<alert type="info">To get the _chat_id_ issue the `/chatid` command inside the chat after having [set up a webhook](/quickstart/setting-webhook) for your bot.</alert>


### through an artisan command

```shell
php artisan telegraph:new-chat {bot_id}
```

the bot_id argument is mandatory if you have created more than one bot

### programmatically

If you are implementing a custom bot creation logic, you can create a new chat using the `TelegraphChat` model:

```php
/** @var TelegraphChat $chat */
$chat = $telegraph_bot->chats()->create([
    'chat_id' => $chat_id,
    'name' => $chat_name,
]);
```
