## How it works

Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Check documentation for [Game Creation](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#games)

### Attachments

Games can be sent through Telegraph `->game()` method:

```php
Telegraph::game('game_short_name')
        ->businessConnectionId('identifier') //identifier of the business connection
        ->messageThreadId('identifier') //identifier for the target message thread (topic) of the forum (forum supergroups only)
        ->messageEffectId('identifier')  //identifier of the message effect to be added to the message (private chats only)
        ->disableNotification() //sends notification with no sound
        ->protectContent() //protects the contents of the sent message from forwarding and saving
        ->allowPaidBroadcast() //pass True to ignore broadcasting limits. Check documentation for limits
        ->send();
```
